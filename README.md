# Locker-Project
We created three lockers, two for Depew Middle school and one for Alden High school. The Depew lockers we created for kids who have trouble opening up there lockers. The Alden Locker is a prototype locker for there school. We used the same hardware design for all the lockers and different code between Depew and Alden because they had different needs.

The Depew High School locker project focuses on customized lockers for individuals with physical disability. According to the needs of the client, each lock has to be designed specifically for each user to solve their problem with accessing the locker independently. Our locker is to help a student with physical or visual impairments so that they can operate the lockers without any trouble.

The Alden locker was designed as an automated and easily operated locker for Alden High School. According to the staff at Alden High School, the current lockers have frequent locker jams. This results in additional custodial resources which can be prevented by having better designed lockers.
